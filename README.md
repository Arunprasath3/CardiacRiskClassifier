# CardiacRiskClassifier

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using clinical input features like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more. It uses a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a heart disease dataset. The model is integrated into a Flask web app where users can enter their health details through a form, and the app displays a prediction indicating whether they are at risk, along with a simple health message. The project also includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visual analysis to understand key patterns influencing heart disease.
